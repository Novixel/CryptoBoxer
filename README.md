    Step 1:
        Insure that python is installed on your system ( python -V ) <-- in terminal or cmd prompt/ps
        Update if needed (Try python3 -V ) before attempting to install a new version
        
        
    Step 2:
        Install or update Pip ( pip -V ) <-- in terminal or cmd prompt/ps
        install pipenv ( pip install --user pipenv ) for easy Virtual Enviroments to easily install our dependancys.
            NOTE:                        _-^
                This does a user installation to prevent breaking any system-wide packages. 
                If pipenv isn’t available in your shell after installation, 
                you’ll need to add the user base’s binary directory to your PATH.
        
        
    Step 3:
        Place all the files from this repo in to a folder, 
        then open up your terminal/cmdprompt and navigate to the folder you just placed the files in, by
        ( cd myfolder )<-- in terminal or cmd prompt/ps
        Now Install dependancys
        ( pipenv install )<-- in terminal or cmd prompt/ps
        
    
    Step 4:
        Open up Sample.py with your text editor of choice to change loops and product id/ currency pair
        Open the terminal and cd to that files directory
        Run 'Sample.py' with python3 ( python3 sample.py )<-- in terminal or cmd prompt/ps
        
    Step 5:
        Enter Your Api Key, 
        Enter Your Api Secret,
        Enter Your Api Passphrase,
        
        How many Test loops?, loop forever with 0 but dont recommend
        1 or 2 should be fine
